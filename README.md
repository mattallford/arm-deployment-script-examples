# About
This repository contains two examples of using Azure Resource Manager Deployment Scripts in IaC deployments, solving real world issues.

The demos here were created and presented at a session for the [Azure Back to School 2022 event](https://azurebacktoschool.github.io/edge%20case/azure-back-to-school-2022-sessions/).

I will link to the Youtube recording here when it has been posted, as you will likely need to watch along with the session for some context on how these examples work.

I hope they help you think of ways to use ARM Deployment Scripts with your IaC deployments!
